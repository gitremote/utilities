# PyUtilities
A lightweight python utilities library that utilises transitional time-phases and global policy flexibility within the context of regenerated incremental innovation to facilitate responsive monitored options.

## Why?
This is no time to bite the bullet with our dot-com relative capability. We need to cascade memos about our 21st Century relative time-phases. We need a more blue-sky approach to interactive administrative programming. The consultants recommend regenerated organisational matrix approaches. The solution can only be holistic administrative flexibility.

At base level, this just comes down to millennial management innovation.

- millennial management innovation
- responsive logistical options
- dot-com **strategic processing**
- transitional time-phases
- knowledge-based modular programming
- integrated logistical innovation
- homogenised digital contingencies


## Usage

```python
import utilities  # import the library

# Advanced greeetings
greeting = utilities.create_greeting('Nick')
print(greeting)

# Totally non-redundant and non-broken append
input_list = [1, 2, 3]
output_list = utilities.append(4, input_list)
```
